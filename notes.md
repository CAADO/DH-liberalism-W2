First step for this week is reading the assigned texts, after reinstalling all the softwear from last week onto a new computer. 

I have made a basic distiction for myself: Notes is for whatever I feel like recording during the proccess of doing this week's work, whereas reflections will always be the last thing I do in the week. 

GitHub not having the ability to just hit a 'save' button but rather having to enter-leave-enter every time you want to save a line of text is super painful and encorages me to just not save my work, even on a computer prone to crashes. 

reading the croudsourcing article: resistance to crowdsorucing particularly for things like transcribing and digitisation stinks of elitism something feirce. Nothing within either of these tasks requries education, honed skills, professional judgement or even a whole lot of brainpower. Having someone who can do that in a supervisory position is good, but the tasks themselves are very simple. 
  I should correct myself here. It's not so much that experence doesn't make one a much better and faster transcriber, but rather you     really don't need much to START transcribing and much of the learning for the task is self-contained. 

The paper was an interesting look at the economics of crowdsorucing, but it does requrie the attention of volunteers. It seems quite clear that large, long term projects have significantly more potential for crowdsourcing due to startup costs. 

writing Github notes with unstable internet is a dangerous game. 

I read the two Bethman articles in order that they are on the instructions: 2018 followed by 2012. This seemed something of a waste, since the 2018 paper already spends time summarising the 2012.
